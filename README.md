A simple app to show how  Lotus works!
===========

This is my first app using the Lotus Framework, that was developed by Luca Guidi. :)


### How to run? ##

 - First you just need to execute in terminal: `git clone git@github.com:brunoocasali/lotus-start.git`.
 - After, you need update your libs, with `bundle install`.
 - AND you CAN run that!
  - execute `rake server`
 - So you can visit after this: http://cabuum.com.br
